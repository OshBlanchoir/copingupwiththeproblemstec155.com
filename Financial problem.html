<h1>FINANCIAL PROBLEM</h1>
<p><h3>For me my problem is my personal allowance/personal financial problem I donâ€™t know how I control myself because I spend all my allowance by buying online like lazada and shopee and because of this situation my allowance in my personal need was affected because I spend a lot on shopping than in my personal needs.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h3>I will think how I can resolve this so I think I will make my own list in my wants to lessen the expenses to all my money on online shopping and also I will prioritize first my personal needs before I spend my money on I want and also control myself to buy some things to learn to save some money.</p></h3>
