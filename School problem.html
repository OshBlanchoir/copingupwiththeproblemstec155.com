<h1>SCHOOL PROBLEM</h1>
<p><h3>"The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet." (Aristotle). Step by step process is part of education, maybe it's a long-term process but still if you work hard on it, time will come and you'll see it's worth it.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h3>In this time, while there's a problem in our world called pandemic (coronavirus), not only the teachers will struggle but also we, students facing many problems too. We may face things like poor grade because of not reading well, studying well or sometimes we cannot focus on the topic because of unused to this way (online learning) so that sometimes we are struggling when it comes to school task especially when it's more. To state here honestly, that matter maybe because of the thing that it's hard to resist things sometimes like using Facebook, Instagram and other applications while having a class. It's hard too, to adjust about the new normal but hoping it'll become okay soon. The family factors will have a big effect too about the student, study. Thereâ€™s a school problems that we, students will encounter and sometimes the other classmates are having an attitude that is not that good and it cause low self-esteem to the other students. It's hard to adjust because the other students are not literate when it comes to technologies which is the new way for learning or else because of poverty and other that is willing and want to study but they can't afford to buy a gadget that they're going to use and sometimes the others doesn't have a continue income so that they're struggling for continue buying load to attend meetings and to do school task.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h3>  Those struggles I have mentioned above, which is what my fellow students experienced too. The other struggles I have mentioned are having solution or should I say all of those struggles are having a solution but the other is too hard to take. Time management is very important focusing on the process that you are taking to aim your goal is a must. Work hard if you really want it and always remember that you are not alone in this world if you need help from the others then tell it, lower your pride or ego. Change is the only thing that is permanent in this world, focus on yourself and don't waste your time for the unnecessary thing especially when it has bad effect to the others life.</p></h3>
