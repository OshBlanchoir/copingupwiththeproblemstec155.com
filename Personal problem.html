<h1>PERSONAL PROBLEM</H1>
<p><h3>As we grow older, we’re encountering too many problems one of this is personal problem. As the time
passed by a fear has been developed within me. I’m afraid to socialize and make friends because of so
much trust issues. Because of this fear I unconsciously build a wall around me to prevent those people
to enter. I distance myself to my friends, and that cause a conflict between us. I also distance myself
from my family I cannot tell to them my problem, I’m so afraid to their opinion about this matter. I lost
so many people in my life because of this fear. I was fighting this problem all by myself without any one
beside me even my friends, because I pushed them away. I really can’t understand myself why I was
pushing them away, even though I really needed a person beside me to talk to. My personal problem
affected my other problems when it comes to family, school and many more. This fear caused me so
much problem, the point that I want to end my life because I cannot handle all of them. This led me to
stress that later on become a depression.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h3>How did I cope up with my problem, up until now I was wondering why I felt peace to a stranger before
but playing a big role to my life now. I was so depressed back then, I cried every night, overthinking of so
many things. I created a dummy account, there I met her. My very special best friend, my girl, she
always talks to me and singing me a song to make me calm. She’s always encouraging me to go out on
my comfort zone and face my fear. Month passed by I was improving I’m gaining friend again and talking
to my old friends that I abandoned before. I even pursue my dream which is teaching because I was
conquering my problems little by little.</p></h3>
<br>
<p><h3>In this problem that I faced, I’ve learned that you need someone to talk to, that can make you feel safe
and make you out on your comfort zone. Don’t let you fear lead your life, because it was a big problem
when it was worsen. Whatever personal problem that you are facing right know, if you don’t feel to talk
to someone try to divert your attention and do the things that you love.</p></h3>
